# Hilary's Intermediate Project/ Smart Lamp with IoT
Hi, my name is Hilary, I am a rising junior from Mills High School.
My project is the “Smart Lamp with IoT”, The smart lamp has serval features such as color changing, temperature and humidity sensing, intruder and light sensing, and emergency messages sending.

# Final Milestone
My first Milestone is the feature of temperature and humidity sensing. (Show my laptop) As you can see, the numbers are a bit unreasonable. I was able to over come this problem by figuring out what is triggering the wrong numbers: Is it the hardware? The Arduino coding? The Cayenne settings? By testing the code and switching the hardware, I was able to target the problem - the hardware. It turns out the batteries were not enough to support the chip. The solution was to connect the chip to my laptop as a battery source instead. The numbers were able to came back to a normal range.

However, following the solution of the problem is another problem, the temperature and humidity number was too low, with temperature being 40 and humidity being 20. I was able to figure out that the temperature is measured in Celsius, and humidity and temperature number was swapped. 

Now all the numbers are working normal. 

My next step is to figure out a custom button of rainbow colors.

# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

My starter project was Simon Says. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working.
